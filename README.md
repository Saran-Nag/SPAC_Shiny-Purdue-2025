# SPAC Interactive Visualization

**Real-time dashboard for spatial single-cell data exploration**

An interactive Shiny for Python dashboard that transforms complex spatial
single-cell datasets into dynamic, explorable visualizations. Just upload your
analyzed data and start discovering biological insights through intuitive point-and-click analysis.

## Why Use This Dashboard?

Spatial single-cell datasets are complex and difficult to explore. This interactive dashboard solves that by providing:

- **Live exploration** - Click, filter, and zoom through your spatial data in real-time
- **No coding required** - Intuitive interface for biologists
- **Multiple view types** - Spatial maps, dimensionality reduction plots, heatmaps, and statistics
- **Hypothesis testing** - Quickly subset data and compare cell populations interactively

## Interactive Features

### �️ **Spatial Visualization**
- **Interactive tissue maps** - Color cells by any feature, zoom into regions of interest
- **Real-time filtering** - Subset cells based on expression, location, or annotations
- **Customizable styling** - Adjust colors, point sizes, and transparency on-the-fly

### 📊 **Statistical Exploration**
- **Dynamic plots** - UMAP, t-SNE, heatmaps, boxplots that update as you filter data
- **Comparative analysis** - Side-by-side visualization of different conditions or cell types
- **Export ready figures** - Generate and download publication-quality plots directly from the interface
